Hi!

I created this repository to showcase my notebooks and powepoint presentaion of my capstone project in the IBM Applied Data Science Professional Certification. 
In this project, I predict the first stage landing success of Space X Falcon 9.

All data was provided by the assignment and is hosted online. The notebook files were completed for the assignment, and some files need to be ran externally, as they will not be interactive in the GitHUb environment.
They should give no issue if ran in a jupyter environment on your local computer.

Enjoy!
